    The post-mission analysis and self-improvement engine.
    After a mission concludes (either in success or failure), this component analyzes

        Analyzes the final state of a completed mission to extract learnings.

        Key analysis functions:
        -   **Pattern Mining**: Identifies common sequences of successful tasks.
            For example, it might learn that `SpecGeneration` -> `CodeManifest` ->
            `CodeGeneration` is a highly recurring pattern for new features.
        -   **Failure Correlation**: Finds correlations between task failures and
            their preceding conditions to identify common pitfalls.
        -   **Heuristic Generation**: Creates new rules or "shortcuts" for agents.
            For example, if a certain type of test failure is always fixed by a
            specific debugging step, it can create a heuristic for the DebuggingAgent.
